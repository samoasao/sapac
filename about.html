          <p class="text-justify">
            SAPAC endeavors to strengthen and unify the Tucson community bringing narratives to life through live theatre and music,
            simultaneously engaging seasoned audiences while cultivating a new generation of artists and theatregoers. Live
            theater has the power to unite communities and foster empathy, a healing outlet for our society. </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Eventually transitioning to an equity house, SAPAC will attract a diversity of talent and a greater, stronger community of
            artists and audiences. This will create new artistic opportunities for local artists in every aspect of theater
            as well as give audiences the chance to widen their scope of what they know. Additionally, giving students (primary
            and college) access to a professional company and experience that allows them to earn points towards an AEA membership.
            We will create opportunities for equitable experience, points, and wages in the arts, which necessitates more
            public funding for the performing arts. Increasing arts funding in turn creates a more equitable and appealing
            industry. Working in tandem with guest directors, choreographers, other equity houses in the region to retain
            talent, foster professionalism, and offer higher quality productions for audiences. </p>

                <strong>DENNIS TAMBLYN</strong> - A native of Arizona, Dennis has had a very unique and varied history in the performing
                arts. Born in Scottsdale, Arizona, Dennis had the privilege to be born into an artistic family. He is the
                youngest of seven children, all of which are musicians and performers including his mother and father. Also,
                his uncle is actor Russ Tamblyn who is known for his roles as “Riff” in the movie version of “West Side Story”
                as well as “Giddeon” in “Seven Brides for Seven Brothers”. Russ’ daughter and Dennis’ cousin Amber Tamblyn
                is also an actress whose credits include Emily Quartermain in “General Hospital”, Joan in the TV series “Joan
                of Arcadia” and Tibby in the “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” movies. </p>



              <p> Dennis was a boy soprano with the world renowned Phoenix Boys Choir where he was able to perform with such
                wonderful artists as Shari Lewis, Doc Severinsen and Mr. Mister (who were alumni of the Phoenix Boys Choir).
                Dennis moved to Tucson in 1997 and pursued a degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics. After receiving
                his degree from the University of Arizona, he realized that his true calling was music and he decided to
                then pursue a 2nd Bachelor’s degree in Voice Performance from the University of Arizona. Primarily focusing
                on opera, Dennis was able to enjoy many wonderful performances and roles with Arizona Opera, The University
                of Arizona Opera Theater, Southern Arizona Opera, Alauda and the Tucson Symphony Orchestra. He was also a
                back-up singer for Barry Manilow during his North America Tour in 2001. </p>


              <p>

                Dennis moved to Greeley Colorado to study opera at the University of Northern Colorado and pursuing a Masters in Voice Performance.
                During this time, Dennis was able to produce, direct and perform in many operatic and musical theater productions.
                He coordinated a school tour in the Denver Metro area, directed and produced an opera scene program, and
                starred in the lead tenor roles of every opera during his studies. Dennis also toured Germany, France and
                Spain during the summer of 2007 with the Germany opera company Opera Classica where he learned 4 roles and
                3 ensemble parts while also winning the Eduardo Villa Competition where he was able to be a featured soloist
                with the Frankfurt Symphony Orchestra.
              </p>


              <p>

                In the fall of 2007, Dennis returned to Tucson and continued his career with Arizona Opera as well as the University of Arizona
                Opera Theater and added experience with Opera New Jersey where he was a young artist. Dennis also was able
                to direct several opera scenes, assistant direct and direct many operas as well as perform solo works with
                Tucson Chamber Artists and Southern Arizona Symphony Orchestra.
              </p>


              <p>

                Dennis was also honored to sing the National Anthem in 2009 for President Barack Obama for the “Together We Thrive” event
                which was a memorial for the tragic shooting that occurred on January 8th, 2011. This event was televised
                to over 31 million viewers world wide.
              </p>


              <p>

                A long time fan and admirer of Musical Theater, Dennis was able to perform in his first musical in 2011 with Arizona OnStage’s
                production of “Sweeney Todd” where he was Pirelli. This led to many more musical theater productions including
                Thenardier in “Les Miserables”, Alfie in “A Man of No Importance”, Max Bialystock in “The Producers” as well
                as Quasimodo in “The Hunchback of Notre Dame”. Dennis is truly a cross over artist and keeps performing musical
                theater while also continuing to perform opera with Arizona Opera.

              </p>

              <p>
                Dennis has also been active on the administrative side of the arts. He was co-founder of the opera company, Opera Distillery
                and was the General Manager of the Gaslight Musical Hall. Dennis is also a Program Coordinator, Senior with
                the University of Arizona where he does Research Administration. This unique skill set has prepared him for
                the journey that SAPAC has in store for him.
