          <p class="text-justify">Local. Like-minded. Longevity.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            SAPAC endeavors to strengthen and unify the Tucson community bringing narratives to life through live
            theatre and music,
            simultaneously engaging seasoned audiences while cultivating a new generation of artists and theatregoers.
            Live
            theater has the power to unite communities and foster empathy, a healing outlet for our society. </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Eventually transitioning to an equity house, SAPAC will attract a diversity of talent and a greater,
            stronger community of
            artists and audiences. This will create new artistic opportunities for local artists in every aspect of
            theater
            as well as give audiences the chance to widen their scope of what they know. Additionally, giving students
            (primary
            and college) access to a professional company and experience that allows them to earn points towards an AEA
            membership.
            We will create opportunities for equitable experience, points, and wages in the arts, which necessitates
            more
            public funding for the performing arts. Increasing arts funding in turn creates a more equitable and
            appealing
            industry. Working in tandem with guest directors, choreographers, other equity houses in the region to
            retain
            talent, foster professionalism, and offer higher quality productions for audiences. </p>

                  <p> Dennis was a boy soprano with the world renowned Phoenix Boys Choir where he was able to perform
                    with such
                    wonderful artists as Shari Lewis, Doc Severinsen and Mr. Mister (who were alumni of the Phoenix Boys
                    Choir).
                    Dennis moved to Tucson in 1997 and pursued a degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics. After
                    receiving
                    his degree from the University of Arizona, he realized that his true calling was music and he
                    decided to
                    then pursue a 2nd Bachelor’s degree in Voice Performance from the University of Arizona. Primarily
                    focusing
                    on opera, Dennis was able to enjoy many wonderful performances and roles with Arizona Opera, The
                    University
                    of Arizona Opera Theater, Southern Arizona Opera, Alauda and the Tucson Symphony Orchestra. He was
                    also a
                    back-up singer for Barry Manilow during his North America Tour in 2001. </p>


                  <p>

                    Dennis moved to Greeley Colorado to study opera at the University of Northern Colorado and pursuing
                    a Masters in Voice Performance.
                    During this time, Dennis was able to produce, direct and perform in many operatic and musical
                    theater productions.
                    He coordinated a school tour in the Denver Metro area, directed and produced an opera scene program,
                    and
                    starred in the lead tenor roles of every opera during his studies. Dennis also toured Germany,
                    France and
                    Spain during the summer of 2007 with the Germany opera company Opera Classica where he learned 4
                    roles and
                    3 ensemble parts while also winning the Eduardo Villa Competition where he was able to be a featured
                    soloist
                    with the Frankfurt Symphony Orchestra.
                  </p>


                  <p>

                    In the fall of 2007, Dennis returned to Tucson and continued his career with Arizona Opera as well
                    as the University of Arizona
                    Opera Theater and added experience with Opera New Jersey where he was a young artist. Dennis also
                    was able
                    to direct several opera scenes, assistant direct and direct many operas as well as perform solo
                    works with
                    Tucson Chamber Artists and Southern Arizona Symphony Orchestra.
                  </p>


                  <p>

                    Dennis was also honored to sing the National Anthem in 2009 for President Barack Obama for the
                    “Together We Thrive” event
                    which was a memorial for the tragic shooting that occurred on January 8th, 2011. This event was
                    televised
                    to over 31 million viewers world wide.
                  </p>


                  <p>

                    A long time fan and admirer of Musical Theater, Dennis was able to perform in his first musical in
                    2011 with Arizona OnStage’s
                    production of “Sweeney Todd” where he was Pirelli. This led to many more musical theater productions
                    including
                    Thenardier in “Les Miserables”, Alfie in “A Man of No Importance”, Max Bialystock in “The Producers”
                    as well
                    as Quasimodo in “The Hunchback of Notre Dame”. Dennis is truly a cross over artist and keeps
                    performing musical
                    theater while also continuing to perform opera with Arizona Opera.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Dennis has also been active on the administrative side of the arts. He was co-founder of the opera
                    company, Opera Distillery
                    and was the General Manager of the Gaslight Musical Hall. Dennis is also a Program Coordinator,
                    Senior with
                    the University of Arizona where he does Research Administration. This unique skill set has prepared
                    him for
                    the journey that SAPAC has in store for him.

                acting
                through her middle school and high school years. During her senior year in high school, she began to
                explore
                the technical aspects of theater when her teacher, noticing her creative and organizational strengths,
                recommended
                that she learn about stage management by shadowing a stage manage at Arizona Theater Company. This
                opportunity
                set the course for the rest of Danielle's life. She fell in love with stage management and continued to
                study
                theater in college at the University of Arizona and Brigham Young University. A polymath at heart, she
                explored
                every aspect of her chosen major that she could, focusing not only on stage management, but scenic
                design,
                costume design, and directing. Outside of theater, she studied art history, mathematics, and Japanese.
